    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability is the scourge of all information systems: knowing what data means, how it is formatted, what the semantics of the various fields are, etc., can be a daunting task. Micro-services are generally designed to process messages in potentially large quantities and, in order to do that, need to know what the messages mean. They are also generally designed to be de-coupled from each other so they can easily be replaced or updated. That means that to construct a system with a micro-service-oriented architecture, you need to have them communicate with each other and you need messages to do that. Those messages have to be well-defined and follow some ground rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain meta-data is needed in any message: some way to trace messages through a multi-micro-service system and tie them back to the original event or command that caused them and the transaction they are a part of, and information to tie it back to the user or tenant (service) that authorized the event or command. This is important for various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- meta-data can be used to trace a single request or event through the entire system: a purchase transaction, for example, will start in the UI and be assigned a random *correlation ID*, after which that correlation ID is used for every command and event that results from that transaction. If anything goes wrong for a particular transaction, the correlation ID is what you can use to know what happened, and where.\n",
    "- meta-data can be used to observe the behavior of any micro-service, or any device if it's produced by a device: a *producer ID* can be added to the message that can then be used to order events if they are produced by a device, or to debug a micro-service if it's showing intermittent bad behavior, for example.\n",
    "- meta-data can be used to provide authentication and authorization in a way that is consistent with zero-trust principles of cybersecurity, using an authorization token to allow an action only if that token is authentic and authorizes that action, and consistently generating an audit trail for observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any message will also have a type and its own id. The former, along with the topic the message is published to, allows the message to be routed to its intended recipients and/or the recipient to filter messages it needs to handle. The latter can be used to make sure a single message is only processed once, especially if the bus being used by the system does not provide a deliver-only-once guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Micro-services also tend to be re-used, and should be designed for re-use and to be composable. They may be re-used on different bus implementations, such as an AMQP bus that has build-in routing, or a Kafka bus that is optimized for high volume and resiliency but leaves the routing to the user. To abstract this away from the user, and to allow messages to bridge buses through data pumps if needed, a few additional recommendations come to mind, which are discussed in this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations discussed in this post, to address the concerns outlined above, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a common super-schema for all messages\n",
    "2. Generate events for anything that happens in the system and post them to an approriate topic on the bus (they can always be ignored if not needed).\n",
    "3. Generate commands *only* if the micro-service needs something to be done by a *generic* micro-service on the bus and that service should be de-coupled from the events generated by the other services (e.g. sending E-mail, running garbage collection tasks, etc.)\n",
    "4. If available, include the authorizing JWT token with the message.\n"

    "\n",
    "Different event bus implementations have different ways to handle meta-data. For micro-services to be both interoperable and agnostic of the bus they're used on, the schema should include any meta-data necessary to parse, track, and trace the event. Individual connectors can always copy the meta-data into header fields for the particular bus if needed.\n",

    "### Sending and receiving events\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally two things you can with a message: you can send one, or you can receive one. Following a single super-schema for all messages certainly makes receiving messages easier: you can validate the received message against the schema and dispatch it to the appropriate handler by parsing only the common fields in the message. Hence, it becomes possible to provide a single, shared implementation for all your micro-services to receive messages from a bus, encapsulating the details of dispatching events to handlers, parsing messages, and even connecting to the bus itself. In this post, I will show this by implementing just such a module in Python, and making it open source to boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "But receiving messages it not the only thing that is facilitated by a common schema: the semantics of most of the metadata fields are well-defined, so some defauly behaviors can be set up for sending messages as well. Again, with this post, I will provide a Python implementation of such default behavior."

Dispatching events to those handlers is a fairly generic job, so let's look at that first.
